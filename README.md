# Numerical Method (◡ ω ◡)

Hello everyone who accesses this repository. This is a public repository for
storing numerical method codes during my lectures.

1. Directory prefixed `week` is code I write when I have a course and I do
   numerical method training.
2. Folder that starts with `task` is the folder that contains my assignments
   in lectures.
3. `oddity` directory is a very funny directory, it is the result of my own
   exploration.
4. Directory named `obidient` is the directory that contains the files where
   I follow the rules that the lecturer directs me to.
5. A folder named `exam` is a question that appears in the semester exam,
   along with my answer.

The rest? support directory only, don't worry!
